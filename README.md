# ðŸ’¸ TipJar

A minimal, fast web app that lets users send thank-you tips using Stripe Checkout. Built with a clean UI and deployed with secure backend integration--no user accounts, no fluff.

## ðŸš€ What It Does
TipJar lets users:
- Enter an amount (in cents)
- Click one button
- Get redirected to Stripe Checkout to complete a secure payment

Itâ€™s a one-page, instant gratitude machine.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite) + TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Payments:** Stripe Checkout
- **Deployments:** 
  - Frontend on Vercel  
  - Backend API on Render

## ðŸ§  What I Learned / Solved

- Implemented Stripe Checkout using clean API integration.
- Faced and solved a deployment bug where Vercel wasn't updating despite correct configuration-- resolved via environment sync and manual redeploys.
- Strengthened understanding of CORS, HTTP status codes, and real-world frontend-backend connection.

## ðŸ§ª Whatâ€™s Not Included (Yet)

- No database or user accounts  
- No tip history or analytics â€” Stripe handles payment records
